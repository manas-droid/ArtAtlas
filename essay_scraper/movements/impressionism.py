    """Collectively the Impressionists sought to capture the impression of a scene through lively brushstrokes and they often worked en plein air, producing works of art rapidly in a single sitting. Rejecting the Salon’s preference for historical or allegorical subjects, they created instead what Monet called a 'spontaneous work rather than a calculated one'. In the 1870s many of the Impressionist painters were predominantly attracted to landscape, searching for ways to capture the fleeting effects of light, weather and time of day on canvas. By the 1880s artists had become more individualised. Renoir turned towards figure painting, Monet considered visual perspective in a more abstract way through seriality and repetition and Degas pursued female figures in informal settings, yet each retained the distinctive rapid brushstrokes, fresh colours and sense of internal light unique to Impressionism. Much like the French Realists, changing Parisian life and the reality of the modern city was a recurring theme for many Impressionists, who painted café scenes, railway bridges and busy boulevards. Although the group was dominated by men, several female artists also rose to prominence including Morisot and Cassatt."""

        """The painting techniques that the Impressionists used to achieve their ideas were fairly consisten. Impressionists strongly emphasised the effects of light in their paintings.
        They used short, thick strokes of paint to capture the essence of the object rather than the subject’s details.Quickly applied brush strokes give the painterly illusion of movement and spontaneity.
        A thick impasto application of paint means that even reflections on the water’s surface appear as substantial as any object in a scene.
        The Impressionists lightened their palettes to include pure, intense colours.Complementary colours were used for their vibrant contrasts and mutual enhancement when juxtaposed.
        Impressionists avoided hard edges by working wet into wet.The surface of an Impressionist painting is opaque. Impressionists did not use the thin paint films and glazes that were popularised by Renaissance artists.
        Impressionists often painted at a time of day when there were long shadows. This technique of painting outdoors helped impressionists better depict the effects of light and emphasise the vibrancy of colours.
        They used Optical Mixing rather than mixing on the palette. Broken colour refers to the effect of blending colours optically rather than on the palette, eliminating perfect coverage and smoothly-blended transitions. The Impressionist painters used layers of colours, leaving gaps in the top layers to reveal the colours underneath. The technique is achieved through hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, drybrushing, and sgraffito (scratching into the paint). Mixing of brighter colours is done directly on the canvas to aid in creating the broken colour effect and only darker colours are mixed on the palette.

        The Impressionist used materials like: Oil paint in a tube. Hog bristle brushes, usually short flats (brights) and long flats. The hog hair brushes that were developed in the 19th century allowed the thick application of paint seen in Impressionist works. The durability and thickness of hog hair is perfect for moving large amounts of thick, heavy paint. Also the pointed wooden end of the paintbrush doubles as a sgraffito tool.
        A brown, wooden hand-held palette. Primed canvas on stretcher bars or canvas on a panel. A crank-handle palette knife. The bent handle keeps the artists knuckles off the surface. Used for mixing on the palette and also for painting in a loose style and a field easel.

        """The first hallmark of impressionist painting is bold brushwork. Impressionists often utilized broad strokes to emulate the vibrancy and movement of the real world. Breaking free from the meticulous detail that characterized previous art forms, they sought to capture the essence of their subject matter rather than creating a finely detailed representation. Painters like Claude Monet and Camille Pissaro are well-known for this technique which adds energy and liveliness to their works""",
         """Color is another critical element in impressionist painting. Artists employed a dramatic use of color, experimenting with warm and cool hues, and complementary and analogous color schemes. Through the deliberate application of color, they portrayed different times of day, seasons, and weather conditions, enhancing the emotional impact of the scene. The careful consideration of color temperature and juxtaposition created a dynamic visual experience, with the use of impasto techniques to apply thick layers of paint contributing further to the texture and vibrancy of the painting.""",
         """The most distinctive characteristic of impressionist art is its depiction of light and atmosphere. Impressionists were masters of portraying the changing qualities of light across different environments, emphasizing how it influences color and form. This often involved painting en plein air (outdoors) to observe and convey the natural interplay of light and landscape directly. Techniques such as broken color, where contrasting colors are placed side by side, helped to recreate the shimmering effect of light on surfaces.""",
         """Loose brushwork was a conscious rebellion against the traditional smooth finish of academic painting. Impressionists used larger brushes and varying grips to make more expressive strokes. Working rapidly was crucial in capturing the feeling of a moment, thus reflecting the spontaneous nature of light and life. Smaller painting studies promoted a focus on the overall impression rather than detailed accuracy.""",
         """The combination of color and light wasn't only about replicating a scene—it was also a vehicle for conveying the emotional content of the painting. Impressionist artists believed that through the interplay of brushwork, color temperature, and edge handling, they could evoke certain feelings and atmospheres within their work.""",
         """Texture in an impressionist painting is often the result of the impasto technique, where paint is applied thickly to create a tactile sense of form. This texture is frequently married to the use of light, with broken color and brushstrokes adding to the painting's luminosity. Such techniques give the artwork a glow that seems to change with differing light conditions, mirroring the fluctuating visual experiences of natural environments""",
         """The quest to depict light with authenticity was a cornerstone of impressionist painting. Artists focused on how light dictated the color and mood of a scene. They explored the contrast between light and shadow, utilizing a limited palette often for a more harmonious effect. Also using color temperature to show the difference between light and shadow, not just dark and light vlaues. By doing so, impressionists like Pierre-Auguste Renoir or Frédéric Bazille were able to craft paintings that pulsated with the life and warmth of the sun or the cool quietude of shade."""

            """Claude Monet is perhaps the most celebrated of the Impressionists. He was renowned for his mastery of natural light and painted at many different times of day in an attempt to capture changing conditions. He tended to create spontaneous impressions of his subjects, using very soft brushstrokes and unmixed colors to generate a subtle sense of vibration, as if nature itself were alive on the canvas. He did not wait for paint to dry before applying successive layers; this "wet on wet" technique produced softer edges and blurred boundaries that suggested three-dimensional planes rather than depicting them realistically. John Singer Sargent painting outside or plein air<, in the tradition of the Barbizon School and Claude Monet. Monet's technique of painting outdoors, known as plein air painting, was practiced widely among the Impressionists. Inherited from the landscape painters of the Barbizon School, this approach led to innovations in the representation of sunlight and the passage of time, two central motifs of Impressionist painting. While Monet is seen as most central to the tradition of plein air painting, Berthe Morisot, Camille Pissarro, John Singer Sargent, Alfred Sisley and many others also painted outside, lucidly portraying the transience of the natural world.""",
            """Impressionists like Edgar Degas, were less interested in painting outdoors, and rejected the idea that painting should be a spontaneous act. Considered a highly skilled draftsman and portraitist, Degas preferred indoor scenes of modern life: people sitting in cafés, musicians in an orchestra pit, ballet dancers performing mundane tasks at rehearsal. He also tended to delineate his forms with greater clarity than Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro, using harder lines and thicker brushstrokes. The Child's Bath (1893) by Mary Cassatt is an example of the intimate domestic scenes sometimes depicted by women Impressionists. Other artists, such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Berthe Morisot, and Mary Cassatt, also focused on the human form, and on the psychology of the individual sitter or protagonist. Renoir, known for his vibrant, saturated colors, depicted the daily activities of characters from his neighborhood of Montmartre, in particular the social pastimes of Parisian society. While Renoir, like Morisot and Cassatt, also painted outdoors, he emphasized the physiognomy and emotional qualities of his subjects rather than the atmospheric conditions of the scene, using light and loose brushwork to highlight the human form""",
            """Whereas the male Impressionists painted figures mainly within the public setting of the city, Berthe Morisot concentrated on the private lives of women in late-19th-century society. The first woman to exhibit with the Impressionists, she created rich compositions that highlight the domestic, highly personal sphere of feminine society, often emphasizing the maternal bond between mother and child, as in The Cradle (1872). Together with Mary Cassatt, Eva Gonzalès, and Marie Bracquemond, she is considered one of the four central female figures of the Impressionist movement. Cassatt was an American painter who moved to Paris in 1866 and began exhibiting with the Impressionists in 1879. She depicted the private sphere of the home but also represented woman in the public spaces of the newly modernized city, as in her masterwork At the Opera (1879). Her paintings feature a number of innovations, including the flattening of three-dimensional space and the application of bright, even garish colors in her paintings, both of which heralded later developments in modern art.""",
            """Since the movement was deeply embedded within Parisian society, Impressionism was greatly influenced by Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann's renovation of the city in the 1860s. The urban project, also referred to as "Haussmannization," sought to modernize the city and largely centered in the construction of wide boulevards which became hubs of public social activity. This reconstruction of the city also led to the rise of the idea of the flâneur: the idler or lounger who roams the public spaces of the city, observing life while remaining detached from the crowd. In many Impressionist paintings, the detachment of the flâneur is closely associated with modernity and the estrangement of the individual within the metropolis. These themes of urbanity are depicted in the work of Gustave Caillebotte, a later proponent of the Impressionist movement, who focused on panoramic views of the city and the psychology of its citizens. Although more realistic in style than other Impressionists, Caillebotte's images, such as Paris, Rainy Day (1877), express the artist's reaction to the changing nature of society, showing a flâneur in his characteristic black coat and top hat strolling through the open space of the boulevard while gazing at passersby. Other Impressionists depicted the fleeting qualities of movement and light within the metropolis, as in Monet's Boulevard des Capucines (1873) and Pissarro's The Boulevard Montmarte, Afternoon (1897). Similarly, these works emphasize the geometrical arrangement of public space through the careful delineation of buildings, trees, and streets. By applying crude brushstrokes and impressionistic streaks of color, the Impressionists evoked the rapid tempo of modern life as a central facet of late-19th-century urban society."""
